# Spanner Example Project

This project is set up with the structure of a basic [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) website.

It has just enough files to quickly get started: a bit of HTML, CSS, and Markdown docs with example content. It's a great way to familiarise yourself with Hugo, or as a starting point for building sites of your own.

## How to Use

1. Drag and drop this folder into [Spanner](https://spanner-app.com)
2. Click Run (or <kbd>âŒ˜</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>)
3. Open <http://localhost:1313> in your browser
4. Edit some HTML, CSS or Markdown, and watch your browser live-refresh with changes
